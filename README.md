# webpack-react-boiler
A simple Webpack 2 setup with React and Sass.

## Usage
npm install

### Develop with webpack server & hot module reload:
npm run dev

### Build for production:
npm run build
Use the files in dist to deploy on your preferred server.

# TODO
- Check if vendor splitting with long term cache is viable
  - chunkhash seems to be one way
